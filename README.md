# STUDENT2STUDENT
ADS Group Project

Student2Student is a platform for connecting students to student for tutoring purposes and providing notes exclusive to IE students 
* it allows students to interact, share notes, and receive tutoring
* it ensures students get their knowledge from approved students who have experience and are informed about the university's methodology

# Installation

To be able to run our main program, you have to have the Python programming language (versions between 3.6 and 3.8) installed. When you launch Python, create a new project and make sure you have these files created in your project with following texts written in them:

* accounts.txt: username1=password1
* notes_list.txt: classachapter1=textfile.txt
* tutors_list.txt: tutor1=subject1
* tutors_contact.txt: tutor1=contact1

Note: These text files help us to store the inputted data by the user as dictionaries.

To be able to run our scheduling program, you have to use Google Colaboratory.

You do not need to install any packages or libraries.

Now, that you have everything set up, create 2 new python files called student2student.py and scheduling.py and run them, respectfully.
